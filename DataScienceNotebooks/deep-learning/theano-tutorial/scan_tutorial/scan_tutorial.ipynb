    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "A Theano function graph is composed of two types of nodes; Variable nodes which represent data and Apply node which apply Ops (which represent some computation) to Variables to produce new Variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this point of view, a node that applies a Scan op is just like any other. Internally, however, it is very different from most Ops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside a Scan op is yet another Theano graph which represents the computation to be performed at every iteration of the loop. During compilation, that graph is compiled into a function and, during execution, the Scan op will call that function repeatedly on its inputs to produce its outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1 : As simple as it gets\n",
    "\n",
    "Scan's interface is complex and, thus, best introduced by examples. So, let's dive right in and start with a simple example; perform an element-wise multiplication between two vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "This particular example is simple enough that Scan is not the best way to do things but we'll gradually work our way to more complex examples where Scan gets more interesting.\n",

    "The parameter `sequences` allows us to specify variables that Scan should iterate over as it loops. The first iteration will take as input the first element of every sequence, the second iteration will take as input the second element of every sequence, etc. These individual element have will have one less dimension than the original sequences. For example, for a matrix sequence, the individual elements will be vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter `fn` receives a function or lambda expression that expresses the computation to do at every iteration. It operates on the symbolic inputs to produce symbolic outputs. It will **only ever be called once**, to assemble the Theano graph used by Scan at every the iterations.\n",
