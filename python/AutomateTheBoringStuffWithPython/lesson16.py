# Recap:
# - Methods are functions that are "called on"  values.
# - The index() list method returns the index of an item in the List.
# - The append() list method adds a value anywhere inside a list.
# - The insert() list method removes an item, specified by the value, from a list.
# - The sort() method reverse=True keyword argument can sort in reverse order.
# - Sorting happens in "ASCII-betical" order. To sort normally, pass key=str.lower.
# - These list methods operate on the list "in place", rather than returning a new list value.
