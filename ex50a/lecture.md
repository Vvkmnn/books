Exercise 50

Routing The Statistics

Project Description
----



The Plan
====

You are now given vague instructions and have to "solve" as best you can.



The Purpose
====

To give you freedom to be creative, and also taste a real project with vague
specifications.

Many times all you get is a single sentence in a bug tracker. Oh well.



The Requirements
====

Allow people to work with statistics at arbitrary URLs in the server.
You get to define what that means, but think "web application".



Pause!
====

Try to solve it on your own then continue.



The Clues
====

Answer these questions:

1. What happens when I have a statistics "under" another, as in /age/northamerica/ is under /age/.
2. Could you do the summary statistics we talked about?  A mean of means and mean of standard deviations that are rolled up the tree?
3. What data structures do you need?  Starting with data is key here too. Data data data.
4. Are your tests good enough?  Before you start you might want to get good tests that use the protocol.



Important References
====

* Definitely look at the statistics code you built in liblcthw if you do the summary statistics.



Encouragement
====

This is hard, as I've said all along, however it is all doable. It's simply a matter of breaking the problems down and tackling each little piece.
