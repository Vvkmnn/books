    "# Object Recognition and Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you should have a basic understanding of TensorFlow and its best practices. We'll follow these practices while we build a model capable of object recognition and classification. Building this model expands on the fundamentals that have been covered so far while adding terms, techniques and fundamentals of computer vision. The technique used in training the model has become popular recently due to its accuracy across challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "[ImageNet](http://image-net.org/), a database of labeled images, is where computer vision and deep learning saw a recent rise in popularity. Annually, ImageNet hosts a challenge (ILSVRC) where people build systems capable of automatically classifying and detecting objects based on ImageNet's database of images. In 2012, the challenge saw a team named [SuperVision](http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/results.html) submit a solution using a creative neural network architecture. ILSVRC solutions are often creative but what set SuperVision's entry apart was its ability to accurately classify images. [SuperVision's entry](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf) set a new standard for computer vision accuracy and stirred up interest in a deep learning technique named convolutional neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have continued to grow in [popularity](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=726791). They're primarily used for computer vision related tasks but are not limited to working with images. CNNs could be used with any data which can be represented as a tensor where values are ordered next to related values (in a grid). [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/convolutional-neural-networks-for-speech-recognition/) released a paper in 2014 where they used CNNs for speech recognition where the input tensor was a single row grid of sound frequencies ordered by the time they were recorded. For images, the values in the tensor are pixels ordered in a grid corresponding with the width and height of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, the focus is working with CNNs and images in TensorFlow. The goal is to build a CNN model using TensorFlow that categorizes images based on a subset of ImageNet's database. Training a CNN model will require working with images in TensorFlow and understanding how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used. The majority of the chapter is dedicated to introducing concepts of computer vision using TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in training this CNN model is a subset of the images available in ImageNet named the [Stanford's Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/). As the name implies, this dataset is filled with images of different dog breeds and a label of the breed shown in the image. The goal of the model is to take an image and accurately guess the breed of dog shown in the image.\n",

    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "If one of the images shown above is loaded into the model, it should output a label of Siberian Husky. These example images wouldn't be a fair test of the model's accuracy because they exist in the training dataset. Finding a fair metric to calculate the model's accuracy requires a large number of images which won't be used in training. The images which haven't been used in training the model will be used to create a separate test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason to bring up the fairness of an image to test a model's accuracy is because it's part of keeping a separated test, train and cross-validation datasets. While processing input, it is a required practice to separate a large percentage of the data used to train a network. This separation is to allow a blind test of a model. Testing a model with input which was used to train it will likely create a model which accurately matches input it has already seen while not being capable of working with new input. The testing dataset is then used to see how well the model performs with data which didn't exist in the training. Over time and iterations of the model, it is possible that the changes being made to increase accuracy are making the model better equipped to the testing dataset while performing poorly in the real world. A good practice is to use a cross-validation dataset to check the final model and receive a better estimate of its accuracy. With images, it's best to separate the raw dataset while doing any preprocessing (color adjustments or cropping) keeping the input pipeline the same across all the datasets."

    "## Convolutional Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, a convolutional neural network is a neural network which has at least one layer (`tf.nn.conv2d`) which does a convolution between its input <span class=\"math-tex\" data-type=\"tex\">\\\\(f\\\\)</span> and a configurable kernel <span class=\"math-tex\" data-type=\"tex\">\\\\(g\\\\)</span> generating the layer's output. In a simplified definition, a convolution's goal is to apply a kernel (filter) to every point in a tensor and generate a filtered output by sliding the kernel over an input tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of the filtered output is edge detection in images. A special kernel is applied to each pixel of an image and the output is a new image depicting all the edges. In this case, the input tensor is an image and each point in the tensor is treated as a pixel which includes the amount of red, green and blue found at that point. The kernel is slid over every pixel in the image and the output value increases whenever there is an edge between colors.\n",

    "\n",
    "It isn't important to understand how convolutions combine input to generate filtered output or what a kernel is until later in this chapter when they're put in practice. Obtaining a broad sense of what a CNN does and its biological inspiration build the technical implementation.\n",

    "In 1968, [an article was published](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1557912/) detailing new findings on the cellular layout of a monkey striate cortex (the section of the brain thought to process visual input). The article discusses a grouping of cells which extend vertically combining together to match certain visual traits. The study of primate brains may seem irrelevant to a machine learning tasks yet it was instrumental [in the development of deep learning](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v521/n7553/full/nature14539.html) using CNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs follow a simplified process matching information similar to the structure found in the cellular layout of a monkey's striate cortex. As signals are passed through a monkey's striate cortex, certain layers will signal when a visual pattern is highlighted. For example, one layer of cells will activate (increase its output signal) when a horizontal line passes through it. A CNN will exhibit a similar behaviour where clusters of neurons will activate based on patterns learned from training. For example, after training, a CNN will have certain layers which activate when a horizontal line passes through it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matching horizontal lines would be a useful neural network architecture but CNNs take it further by layering multiple simple patterns to match complex patterns. In the context of CNNs, these patterns are known as filters or kernels and the goal is to adjust these kernel weights until they accurately match the training data. Training these filters is often accomplished by combining multiple different layers and learning weights using gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple CNN architecture may combine a convolutional layer (`tf.nn.conv2d`), non-linearity layer (`tf.nn.relu`), pooling layer (`tf.nn.max_pool`) and a fully connected layer (`tf.matmul`). Without these layers, it's difficult to match complex patterns because the network will be filled with too much information. A well designed CNN architecture highlights important information while ignoring noise. We'll go into details on how these layers work together later in this chapter.\n",

    "The input image for this architecture is a complex format designed to support the ability to load batches of images. Loading a batch of images allows the computation of multiple images simultaneously but it requires a more complex data structure. The data structure used is a rank four tensor including all the information required to convolve a batch of images. TensorFlow's input pipeline (which is used to read and decode files) has a special format designed to work with multiple images in a batch including required information for an image (`[image_batch_size, image_height, image_width, image_channels]`). Using the example code, it's possible to examine the structure of an example input used while working with images in TensorFlow."
