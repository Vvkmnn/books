# Wikipedia Word Embeddings

To train a set of embedded word vectors, run `train.py`:

```
$ python3 train.py
```

This will save your word embeddings into `./wikipedia/embeddings.npy`

Unfortunately, at this time the sample code is only compatible with Python 3. We're working on providing Python 2 translations of the code.
