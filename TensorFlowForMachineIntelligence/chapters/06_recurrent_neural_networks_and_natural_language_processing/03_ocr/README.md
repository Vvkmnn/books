# RNN and Bi-directional RNN for OCR

To run and train the standard RNN, simply run `train.py`:

```
$ python3 train.py
```

To run the bi-directional RNN, use `train_bidirectional.py`:

```
$ python3 train_bidirectional.py
```

Unfortunately, at this time the sample code is only compatible with Python 3. We're working on providing Python 2 translations of the code.
