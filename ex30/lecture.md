Learn C The Hard Way

Exercise 30
----

Automated Testing



The Plan
====

Continue the Exercise 28-29 project and add automated tests to it.



Why Automate Tests
====

You are a programmer.
Your job is automating.

EVERYTHING
----



The Code
====



Adding It To libex29
====



Breaking It
====

* Making tests fail first is useful.



Extra Credit
====

* This works but it's probably a bit messy.  Clean the ``c-skeleton``
  directory up so that it has all of these files, but remove any of the code
  related to Exercise 29.  You should be able to copy this directory
  over and kick-start new projects without much editing.
* Study the ``runtests.sh``, and then go read about ``bash`` syntax
  so you know what it does.  Do you think you could write a C version of this
  script?
