======

These are a collection of books & resources I've enjoyed learning from and often come back to.

All code included here is my own interpretation unless otherwise referenced, and should in no way reflect on the authors & works used. I am super thankful to all these amazing people who took the time to design such excellent materials; especially the ones who published their work using open source standards. I have created this collection so they may can provide as much value to the next student as they did to me.

### [The Open Source Data Science Masters](https://github.com/datasciencemasters/go)

  Maintained by Clare Corthell

A hand made open-source curriculum for Data Science as designed by some of the best in the field. This is probably the single most important repository included in here, and I would highly recommend you start here if you haven't already gotten started with data science; it's where I did ([after the Coursera course from Andrew Ng blew my mind](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)).

### [Galvanize Data Science Primer](https://github.com/zipfian/data-science-primer)

An excellent collection of resources I recieved as part of my discussion with Galvanize about their awesome [data science bootcamp](http://www.galvanize.com/courses/data-science/#.V4aUq5MrLOQ).

### [Data Science iPython Notebooks](https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks)

  Maintained By Donne Martin

A clone of the [Data Science iPython Notebooks Repository](https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks). A continually updated collection of iPython/Jupyter notebooks on every subject from scikit-learn to AWS. Chances are if it's related to data science, there's a beautifully maintained notebook about it somewhere in here.

### [Automate The Boring Stuff with Python](https://github.com/Vvkmnn/books/tree/master/AutomateTheBoringStuffWithPython)

  By Allen Sweigart

My journey through Al Sweigart's fun and straightforward take on some Python. His course is available as a [book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593275994/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1593275994&linkCode=as2&tag=playwithpyth-20&linkId=2KIYOE7RFLG7D2RJ), a video course on [Udemy](udemy.com/automate), and for free [online](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). I'd consider this a 'Python 101' book, with the additional bonus of some very practical examples.

### [Think Bayes](https://github.com/Vvkmnn/books/tree/master/ThinkBayes)
<img align="right" src="http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkbayes/think_bayes_cover_medium.png" width="150" border="1" style="border-color: black"/>

  By Allen Downey (Repurposed from Roger Labbe)

An interactive take on Allen Downey's excellent primer on Bayesian Statistics, using some Python examples. His [work](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-bayes/) is available as a [book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449370780/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1449370780&linkCode=as2&tag=greenteapre01-20), a [LaTeX file](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkBayes/blob/master/book/book.tex) with supporting code in his [Github Repository](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkBayes2), and for free [online](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkbayes/html/index.html). I have borrowed an amazing [interactive Jupyter notebook version](https://github.com/rlabbe/ThinkBayes) created by [Roger Labbe](https://github.com/rlabbe) to append with my own learning as I work through it.

### [Data Science from Scratch](https://github.com/joelgrus/data-science-from-scratch)
<img align="right" src="http://joelgrus.com/images/dsfs.jpg" width="150" border="1" style="border-color: black"/>

  By Joel Grus

A clone of supplemental materials for [Data Science from Scratch](https://github.com/joelgrus/data-science-from-scratch) by Joel Grus. It is part of the venerable "O'Reilly" family, and is a the closest I've come to a [Data Science Handbook](http://joelgrus.com/2015/04/26/data-science-from-scratch-first-principles-with-python/).

### [Mining the Social Web (2nd Edition)](https://github.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition)
<img align="right" src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/67/9d/14/679d14bee634bfbc7b442a66998df9a9.jpg" width="150" border="1" style="border-color: black"/>
  
  By Matthew A. Russell

A clone of [Mining the Social Web, 2nd Edition](https://github.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition). Available as a [book](http://bit.ly/135dHfs), a [website](http://MiningTheSocialWeb.com), and as a [virtual machine.](https://rawgithub.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition/master/ipynb/html/_Appendix A - Virtual Machine Experience.html) Easily some of the most practical recipes for dealing with social data, and the basis for a lot of my scripts at work.

### [Programming F# 3.0](https://www.amazon.ca/Programming-F-3-0-Smith/dp/1449320295)
<img align="right" src="https://images.contentreserve.com/ImageType-400/2858-1/546/CE2/7C/%7B546CE27C-29F9-45CD-B3CE-3C7BE93D2BCC%7DImg400.jpg" width="150"/>

  By Chris Smith

An introductory book on  [F#](http://fsharp.org/) that comes [highly recommended](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-book-to-learn-F), and also provides a relatively friendly entry into the mysterious world of (functional programming)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming#Python] which is basically like programming with just python `lambda` functions. 


<br />
<br />
<br />
### [Practical Vim](https://pragprog.com/book/dnvim2/practical-vim-second-edition)
<img align="right" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/417%2BxcRYtLL._SX258_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="150" border="1" style="border-color: black"/>

  By Drew Neil

A series of exercises following [Practical Vim](https://pragprog.com/book/dnvim2/practical-vim-second-edition). Basically a group of arcane commands that let you take advantage of one of the most powerful (and occasionally tempermental) text editors ever designed. I personally prefer using it via its [VimR](http://vimr.org/) incarnation, and I highly recommend it for macOS users.
