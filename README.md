# Books

A collection of books & resources I've enjoyed exploring and often come back to. All code included here is my own interpretation unless otherwise stated, and should in no way reflect on the authors & works used. I am thankful so many amazing authors have decided to publish their work using open source standards, and I hope to collect the ones I can in here so even more people can benefit from their work.

An interactive take on Allen Downey's excellent primer on Bayesian Statistics, using some Python examples. His [work](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-bayes/) is available as a [book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449370780/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1449370780&linkCode=as2&tag=greenteapre01-20), a [LaTeX file](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkBayes/blob/master/book/book.tex) with supporting code in his [Github Repository](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkBayes2), and for free [online](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkbayes/html/index.html). I have borrowed an amazing [interactive Jupyter notebook version](https://github.com/rlabbe/ThinkBayes) created by [Roger Labbe](https://github.com/rlabbe) to append with my own learning.

A clone of supplemental materials for [Data Science from Scratch](https://github.com/joelgrus/data-science-from-scratch) by Joel Grus. It is part of the venerable "O'Reilly" family, and is a the closest I've come to a [Data Science Handbook](http://joelgrus.com/2015/04/26/data-science-from-scratch-first-principles-with-python/).

Maintained By Donne Martin

A clone of the [Data Science iPython Notebooks Repository](https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks). A continually updated collection of iPython/Jupyter notebooks on every subject from scikit-learn to AWS. Chances are if it's related to data science, there's a beautifully maintained notebook about it somewhere in here.
