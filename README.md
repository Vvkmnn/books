# Books

These are a collection of books & resources I've enjoyed learning from and often come back to. All code included here is my own interpretation unless otherwise stated, and should in no way reflect on the authors & works used. I am thankful so many amazing authors have published their work using open source standards, and I have created this collection so they may provide as much value to the next student as it did to me.

  By Allen Downey (Repurposed from Roger Labbe)



An interactive take on Allen Downey's excellent primer on Bayesian Statistics, using some Python examples. His [work](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-bayes/) is available as a [book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449370780/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1449370780&linkCode=as2&tag=greenteapre01-20), a [LaTeX file](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkBayes/blob/master/book/book.tex) with supporting code in his [Github Repository](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkBayes2), and for free [online](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkbayes/html/index.html). I have borrowed an amazing [interactive Jupyter notebook version](https://github.com/rlabbe/ThinkBayes) created by [Roger Labbe](https://github.com/rlabbe) to append with my own learning.

  By Allen Sweigart

My journey through Al Sweigart's fun and straightforward take on some Python. His course is available as a [book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593275994/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1593275994&linkCode=as2&tag=playwithpyth-20&linkId=2KIYOE7RFLG7D2RJ), a video course on [Udemy](udemy.com/automate), and for free [online](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). I'd consider this a 'Python 101' book, with the additional bonus of some very practical examples.

By Joel Grus

A clone of supplemental materials for [Data Science from Scratch](https://github.com/joelgrus/data-science-from-scratch) by Joel Grus. It is part of the venerable "O'Reilly" family, and is a the closest I've come to a [Data Science Handbook](http://joelgrus.com/2015/04/26/data-science-from-scratch-first-principles-with-python/).

By Matthew A. Russell

A clone of [Mining the Social Web, 2nd Edition](https://github.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition). Available as a [book](http://bit.ly/135dHfs), a [website](http://MiningTheSocialWeb.com), and as a [virtual machine.](https://rawgithub.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition/master/ipynb/html/_Appendix A - Virtual Machine Experience.html) Easily some of the most practical recipes for dealing with social data, and the basis for a lot of my scripts at work.

A clone of the [Data Science iPython Notebooks Repository](https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks). A continually updated collection of iPython/Jupyter notebooks on every subject from scikit-learn to AWS. Chances are if it's related to data science, there's a beautifully maintained notebook about it somewhere in here.
