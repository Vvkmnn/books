## Python


#### [Automate The Boring Stuff with Python](https://github.com/Vvkmnn/books/tree/master/python/AutomateTheBoringStuffWithPython)

  By Al Sweigart.

My journey through Al Sweigart's fun and straightforward take on some Python 3. His course is available as a [book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593275994/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1593275994&linkCode=as2&tag=playwithpyth-20&linkId=2KIYOE7RFLG7D2RJ), a video course on [Udemy](udemy.com/automate), and for free [online](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).

Maintained By Donne Martin

A clone of the [Data Science iPython Notebooks Repository](https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks). A continually updated collection of iPython/Jupyter notebooks on every subject from scikit-learn to AWS. Chances are if it's related to data science, there's a beautifully maintained notebook about it somewhere in here.
