"""This file contains a solution to an exercise from Think Bayes,
by Allen B. Downey

I got the idea from Tom Campbell-Ricketts author of the Maximum
Entropy blog at 

http://maximum-entropy-blog.blogspot.com

And he got the idea from E.T. Jaynes, author of the classic
_Probability Theory: The Logic of Science_.

Here's the version from Think Bayes:

Radioactive decay is well modeled by a Poisson process; the
probability that an atom decays is the same at any point in time.

Suppose that a radioactive source emits particles toward a Geiger
counter at an average rate of $r$ particles per second, but the
counter only registers a fraction, $f$, of the particles that hit it.
If $f$ is 10\% and the counter registers 15 particles in a one second
interval, what is the posterior distribution of $n$, the actual number
of particles that hit the counter, and $p$, the average rate particles
are emitted?
