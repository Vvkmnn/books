Exercise 31
----

Common Undefined Behavior



The Plan
====

Review the issues around Undefined and Unspecified Behavior (UB).



Read The Book
====

The book lists many of the UB and discusses why they are important to know 
about.



The Code
====

There is no code for this exercise, just a quick discussion for the book.



Undefined Behavior
====

* Compiler writers can do whatever they want.
* This means even *nothing*, which will ruin you silently.
* It's best to avoid it.



Unspecified Behavior
====

* For practical purposes unspecified is the same as undefined.



Handy Tools
====

* Clang's UB helpful flags.
* Lint tools and static analyzers.



Extra Credit
====

Spend a day reading through as much of the UB as you can and find examples of each.  Expect lots of frustration and failure when you do this.
