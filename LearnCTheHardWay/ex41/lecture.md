Learn C The Hard Way
=======

Exercise 41
----

Project devpkg



The Plan
====

Create a handy little tool called devpkg.

This will be a *lot* of work, so this video is more complete.



Demonstration
====

I'll demonstrate how devpkg works so you get a better idea.

Read the book's description as well for more details.



The Apache Portable Runtime
====

Review of the APR and installing it.



The Analysis
====

Walk through the code, where everything is, and what to watch out for.



Getting My Code
====

If you get stuck you can check out the learn-c-the-hard-way-lectures project:

https://github.com/zedshaw/learn-c-the-hard-way-lectures

And look in ex41/devpkg for the code.



Extra Credit
====

* Compare your code to my code available online.  Starting with 100%,
  remove 1% for each line you got wrong.
* Take the notes.txt file that you previously created and implement your improvements to the the code and functionality
  of ``devpkg``.
* Write an alternative version of ``devpkg`` using your other
  favorite language or the one you think can do this the best.  Compare
  the two, then improve your *C* version of ``devpkg`` based on what
  you've learned.
