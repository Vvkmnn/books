Learn C The Hard Way

Exercise 13
----

For-Loops and Arrays of Strings



The Plan
====

Learn about this code:

    for(INITIALIZER; TEST; INCREMENTER) {
        CODE;
    }

The Analysis

Breaking It
====

* Take your favorite other language and use it to run this program, but include as many command line arguments as possible.  See if you can bust it
  by giving it way too many arguments.
* Initialize *i* to 0 and see what that does.  Do you have to adjust
  *argc* as well, or does it just work?  Why does 0-based indexing work
  here?
* Set *num_states* wrong so that it's a higher value and see what
  it does.



Extra Credit
====

* Figure out what kind of code you can put into the parts of a *for-loop*.
* Look up how to use the comma character (,) to separate multiple
  statements in the parts of the *for-loop*, but between the semicolon characters (;).
* Read what a *NULL* is and try to use it in one of the elements from the
  *states* array to see what it'll print.
* See if you can assign an element from the *states* array to the
  *argv* array before printing both.  Try the inverse.
