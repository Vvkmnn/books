Learn C The Hard Way
=======

Exercise 7
----

Variables and Types



The Plan
====

* Learn some basic variables and types.
* int, float, double, char, and strings.



The Code
====



The Analysis
====



Breaking It
====

* Strings give us so much more fun now!
* Crafting bad strings.
* Messing with pointers.
* Abusing printf.



Extra Credit
====

* Make the number you assign to *universe_of_defects* various
  sizes until you get a warning from the compiler.
* What do these really huge numbers actually print out?
* Change *long* to *unsigned long* and try to find
  the number that makes it too big.
* Go search online to find out what *unsigned* does.
* Try to explain to yourself (before I do in the next exercise)
  why you can multiply a *char* and an *int*.
