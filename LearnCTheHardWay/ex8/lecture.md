Exercise 8
----

If, Else-If, Else



The Plan
====

Simply learn to use this:

    if(TEST) {
        CODE;
    } else if(TEST) {
        CODE;
    } else {
        CODE;
    }



The Code
====



The Analysis
====



Breaking It
====

* It kind of just works, but remove the *else* and change the logic.



Extra Credit
====

* You were briefly introduced to *&&*, which does an *and* comparison,
  so go research online the different *Boolean operators*.
* Write a few more test cases for this program to see what you can come
  up with.
