Memorizing C Operators



The Plan
====

* Learn why memorizing works.
* Learn how to memorize things.
* Review the C operators.



Memorization
====

* A "backdoor" hack to learning.
* Memorize the operators, then reading is easier.
* Works with any language.



Memorization Proces
====

* Write everything on index cards.
* Use Anki, but make your own cards.
* Spend 30-60 minutes a day.
* Track what you don't know, drill those more.



Arithmetic Operators
=====

    +    Add
    -    Subtract
    *    Multiply
    /    Divide
    %    Modulus
    ++   Increment
    --   Decrement



Relational Operators
=====

    ==   Equal
    !=   Not equal
    >    Greater than
    <    Less than
    >=   Greater than equal
    <=   Less than equal



Logical Operators
=====

    &&   Logical and
    ||   Logical or
    !    Logical not
    ? :  Logical ternary



Bitwise Operators
=====

    &    Bitwise and
    |    Bitwise or
    ^    Bitwise xor
    ~    Bitwise ones compliment
    <<   Bitwise shift left
    >>   Bitwise shift right



Assignment Operators
=====

    =    Assign equal
    +=   Assign plus-equal
    -=   Assign minus-equal
    *=   Assign multiply-equal
    /=   Assign divide-equal
    %=   Assign modulus-equal
    <<=  Assign shift-left-equal
    >>=  Assign shift-right-equal
    &=   Assign and-equal
    ^=   Assign xor-equal
    |=   Assign or-equal



Data Operators
=====

    sizeof() Get the size of
    []       Array subscript
    &        The address of
    *        The value of
    ->       Structure dereference
    .        Structure reference



Miscellaneous Operators
=====

    ,         Comma
    ( )       Parenthesis
    { }       Braces
    :         Colon
    //        Single-line comment start
    /*        Multi-line comment start
    */        Multi-line comment end
